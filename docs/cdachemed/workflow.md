An MTP item is to insert a medication into the patient's treatment plan and instruct the patient to take it, even if it wasn't prescribed or dispensed: the patient may already have it.

A PRE item is purely a logistic document. It instructs the pharmacist to dispense that medication and allow reimbursment by insurances. Paper prescriptions combine these two usages.

A DIS item is to indicate the medication has been dispensed. It's useful to pharmacists to determine if a prescription may still be dispensed.

A PADV item is used to modify the content or the status, or to comment the previous items.
