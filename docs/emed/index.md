# CH EMED EPR

[CH EMED EPR](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-emed-epr/index.html) is a FHIR implementation guide that specifies mostly the eMedication service's exchange format.

It is built upon [CH EMED](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-emed/index.html) (the Swiss eMedication profile), [CH CORE](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html).
In particular, CH-EMED contains a lot of documentation about the use of the profile, it is highly recommended reading it.

!!! tip

    This format is the only one supported by the eMedication service since January, 2023.
