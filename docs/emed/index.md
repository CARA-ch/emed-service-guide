Its specification are entirely described in [https://build.fhir.org/ig/CARA-ch/ch-emed-epr/](https://build.fhir.org/ig/CARA-ch/ch-emed-epr/).

It is built upon [CH-EMED](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-emed/) (the Swiss eMedication profile), [CH-CORE](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-core/) and [CH-Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/index.html).
In particular, CH-EMED contains a lot of documentation about the use of the profile, it is highly recommended reading it.
